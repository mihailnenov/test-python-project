# Jenkinsfile for deploying the service to the environment specified in the "environment" paremeter from the
# Jenkins pipeline configuraition.
# Assuming:
# 1. The Jenkins pipeline is configured with Git plugin and project is cloned before the script is run.
# 2. Ansible is installed together with Jenkins on the same machine (other option would be to use Ansible Tower)
# 3. Ansible inventories and playooks are available in /opt/ansible/provision-python/
# 4. Ansible roles are pre-installed on the Jenkins host machine
